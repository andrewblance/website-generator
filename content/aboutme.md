Hello, my name is Andrew. I am currently a PhD student in the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) and Institute for Data Science (IDAS) at Durham University. Here, my research interests include using Machine Learning and Data Science to solve problems and investigate High Energy Physics. A good example of what I am interested in researching can be found in "Adversarially-trained autoencoders for robust unsupervised new physics searches" [1], a paper I co-wrote.

Through my PhD I have had the chance to go on a number of internships. These have been at INSPIRE, Jumping Rivers and Waterstons. This has allowed me to get a wide variety of experiences applying data science methods and consulting. I have also had the opportunity to teach courses about Python and deep learning throughout the UK and Ireland, showing people in industry and academia how to use data science methods in their work. 

Outside of academia I enjoy learning different programming languages and playing with them. I've spent time making small (and bad) games using c++ and Python. I have a hamster called Balthazar. I help out running a student cinema, acting as a projectionist. Recently me and my friend started a terrible band and now we have an EP out on Spotify. We are called Dioramarama. Check us out using one of the links below.
