Hello, my name is Andrew. I am currently a PhD student in the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) and Institute for Data Science (IDAS) at Durham University. Here, my research interests include using Machine Learning and Data Science to solve problems and investigate High Energy Physics. A good example of what I am interested in researching can be found in "Adversarially-trained autoencoders for robust unsupervised new physics searches" [1], a paper I co-wrote.

Through my PhD I have had the chance to go on a number of internships. These have been at INSPIRE, in Geneva, and Jumping Rivers, located in Newcastle. In the latter I built an app to help make and optimise rotas. This was done using Python for the back-end stuff and Shiny for the front-end.

Outside of academia I enjoy learning different programming languages and playing with them. I've spent time making small (and bad) games using c++ and Python and I am currently learning 6502 assembly with the same goal to make a small (and probably bad) game.
